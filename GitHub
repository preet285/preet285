GitHub is a web-based interface that uses Git, the open source version control software that lets multiple people make separate changes to web pages at the same time. 
As Carpenter notes, because it allows for real-time collaboration, GitHub encourages teams to work together to build and edit their site content. 
GitHub, Inc. is a provider of Internet hosting for software development and version control using Git. 
It offers the distributed version control and source code management (SCM) functionality of Git, plus its own features. 
It provides access control and several collaboration features such as bug tracking, feature requests, task management, 
continuous integration and wikis for every project.[4] Headquartered in California, it has been a subsidiary of Microsoft since 2018.[5]
It is commonly used to host open-source projects.[6] As of November 2021, GitHub reports having over 73 million developers[7] and more than 200 million repositories[8] (including at least 28 million public repositories).[9] It is the largest source code host as of November 2021.
